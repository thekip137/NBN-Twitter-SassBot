@NBN_Australia Who will win? 10 Netflix users streaming at 1080p or 1 expensive and useless broadband network
Hey @NBN_Australia, I was going to send you a picture of a turd to represent the NBN, but it would have taken 3 hours to upload
Pssst @NBN_Australia, I found the secret to getting consistent internet speeds even during peak: Its called NOT USING COPPER
Yo @NBN_Australia, yo mumma so old she is even more crusty than the copper network you use for the NBN
Yo @NBN_Australia im really happy for you and imma let you finish but the NBN was the biggest blunder of all time.
