Hey @NBN_Australia @Optus my current speed is {0}Mbs down and {1}Mbs up. I pay for 100/40, should I only pay {2}% of my bill? #FixTheNBN
Hey @NBN_Australia @Optus im getting {0}% of my download speed when I pay 100% of my bill. Come on now, get it together.
Oi @NBN_Australia @Optus for $100+/month I expect better than {0}Mbs when I'm paying for 100Mbs. Fix your network!
This download speed of {0}Mbs (when I pay for 100Mbs) is brought to you by HFC, tech from the late 90's
Well @NBN_Australia Optus I guess {0}Mbs is better than nothing, still not worth 100+/month when I expect 100Mbs
